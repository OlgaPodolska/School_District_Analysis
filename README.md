# School_District_Analysis
School Budget using Python and Anaconda


* A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
* An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
* Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
    * Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
    * The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
    * The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
    * School performance based on the budget per student
    * School performance based on the school sizeÂ 
    * School performance based on the type of school

The school district summary will be a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics:
* Total number of students
* Total number of schools
* Total budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* Percentage of students who passed math
* Percentage of students who passed reading
* Overall passing percentage
We'll find this information and visualize the data with a table like the following:

To get the percentage of students who passed math and reading, we will write code to:
* Determine the passing grade.
* Get the number of students who passed math and reading in separate DataFrames.
* Calculate the number of students who passed math and reading.
* Calculate the percentage of students who passed math and reading.
* To get the overall passing percentage, we will write code to:
* Get the number of students who passed both math and reading in a DataFrame.
* Calculate the number of students who passed both math and reading.
* Calculate the percentage of students who passed both math and reading.
